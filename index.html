          <h2>Etymology</h2>
          <p>
            "Boiler plate" originally referred to the maker's label used to
            identify the builder of steam boilers.[1]
          </p>
          <p>
            In the field of printing, the term dates back to the early 1900s.
            From the 1890s onwards, printing plates of text for widespread
            reproduction such as advertisements or syndicated columns were cast
            or stamped in steel (instead of the much softer and less durable
            lead alloys used otherwise) ready for the printing press and
            distributed to newspapers around the United States. By analogy, they
            came to be known as 'boilerplates'. One large supplier to newspapers
            of this kind of boilerplate was the Western Newspaper Union, which
            supplied "ready-to-print stories [which] contained national or
            international news" to papers with smaller geographic footprints,
            which could include advertisements pre-printed next to the
            conventional content.[2]
          </p>
          <p>
            Some companies also sent out press releases as boilerplate so that
            they had to be printed as written. The modern equivalent is the
            press release boilerplate, or "boiler," a paragraph or two that
            describes the company and its products.
          </p>

        <div class="para_wrapper">
          <h2>Boilerplate Language</h2>

          <p>
            In contractual law, the term "boilerplate language" describes the
            parts of a contract that are considered standard.
          </p>

          <p>
            Boilerplate language may also exist in pre-created form letters on
            the Internet for such things as issues to be broached by a
            politician based on an issue ad, requests that a cable or satellite
            operator add a cable network to a system, pre-written complaints
            about a product that is opposed by groups that create such letters,
            or online petitions. The person requesting the action usually only
            needs to type or sign his or her name at the end of the pre-written
            greeting and body.

          <h2>Boilerplate Code</h2>

          <p>
            In computer programming, boilerplate is the sections of code that
            have to be included in many places with little or no alteration.
            Such boilerplate is particularly salient when the programmer must
            include a lot of code for minimal functionality. The need for
            boilerplate can be reduced through high-level mechanisms.
          </p>
          <p>
            A related phenomenon, bookkeeping code, is code that is not part of
            the business logic but is interleaved with it in order to keep data
            structures updated or able to handle secondary aspects of the
            program.
